Prepare yourselves for a thrilling experience filled with peril, laughter, and maybe a little bit of crying (don't worry, we'll have tissues...maybe). Let the games begin!\n\n\nSophia, the Fairy, enters the arena!  With 100 health, a sword and shield for defense,  80 attack, 30 defense, 40 speed, 30 charm, 40 intelligence, and 70 magic power,  Sophia is... well, let's just say she's got potential! Her attack and magic power are decent, but her defense could use some work.  Good luck, Sophia \u2013 you'll need it!\n"
