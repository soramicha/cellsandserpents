      "Welcome, beach volleyball gladiators, to the ultimate showdown of sun, sand, and\u2026 well, maybe not so much sun if you're Angela!  Prepare yourselves for a tournament so intense, it'll make your sunscreen melt!\n\n\nAngela, the fairy, enters the arena with a hopeful smile and a load of... nothing.  Seriously, her equipment is listed as \"nothing. useless.\"  Her health level is a measly 10, her attack a pathetic 1, and her defense a laughable 2.  With speed, charm, intelligence, and magic power all hovering around the same underwhelming levels, let's just say she'll need a miracle (or a really, really good sunscreen) to survive this.  Good luck, Angela! You'll need it.\n\n\nBri, the fairy, on the other hand, is a force to be reckoned with!  This queen of the court boasts a whopping 100 health level, packing a punch with 100 attack and a rock-solid 100 defense. With her amazing stats, she is equipped with everything, the epitome of a champion.  Her speed, charm, intelligence, and magic power also excel, making her a true contender.  Look out, competition; Bri's here to claim victory and bask in the glory!  Get ready for a beach volleyball hurricane!\n"
