      "Welcome, bowlers, to the most exhilarating, most unpredictable, and frankly, most bizarre survival game EVER conceived!  Prepare to strike... or be struck down! Forget pins, we're talking about survival against the odds, and your bowling ball? That's just your personality.  Let's meet our contestants:\n\n\nAngela, the Fairy, enters the arena with a pathetic 10 health points.  Her equipment? \"Nothing. Useless.\"  Seriously?  She boasts an attack, defense, and speed of 1, 2, and 22222 respectively which may be helpful, but what good is speed when you have the health of a wilting daisy?  Let's hope her charm level of 999999 is enough to bribe the other players into sparing her.  Good luck, you'll need it.  Her intelligence is at a 3 and her magic power level is also a 3.\n\n\nSophia, the Fairy, strides into the arena with the grace of a champion!  Her 100 health points suggest a certain resilience; her sword and shield speak of a warrior's spirit. With an attack of 80, defense of 30, and speed of 40,  Sophia is a force to be reckoned with!  She may need to work on her charm (30), but her intelligence and magic power are at a respectable 40 and 70, respectively.  Prepare to be bowled over by this powerhouse!\n"
