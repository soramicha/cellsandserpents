      "Welcome, brave adventurers, to the ultimate test of wits and brawn! Forget your textbooks \u2013 today, your knowledge is your weapon, and your enemy is a particularly grumpy goblin with a penchant for pop quizzes!  Prepare to battle monstrous equations while dodging vocabulary-based volleys!  Let's meet our contestants...\n\nAngela, the fairy, enters the arena.  With a health level of only 10, and wielding...nothing.  Useless, she says. Oh dear.  An attack level of 1, a defense of 2, and a speed of 22222 makes us wonder if she's more likely to outrun the goblin than actually fight it. Her charm level is high at 999999, and intelligence is 3, so maybe she can charm the goblin into passing the test for her?  Magic power is also 3, so good luck with that!  Let's hope her charm is enough.\n\n\nSophia, the Fairy, strides confidently into the fray!  With a whopping 100 health points and a formidable arsenal of a sword and shield, she's already looking like a serious contender.  Her attack (80), defense (30), and speed (40) are all incredibly impressive. With intelligence and magic power at 40 and 70 respectively, she's clearly not just a warrior but a strategic mastermind too!  Sophia, you're going to crush it!\n"

Sophia barely broke a sweat; her mighty punch sent the goblin reeling, not quite a KO, but enough to make it reconsider its life choices.  Because of the underwhelming nature of the victory, the goblin was only slightly impressed.  Sophia received a modest reward, a slightly-used goblin-made pencil case.\n",
